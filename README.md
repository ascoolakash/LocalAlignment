# LocalAlignment
Longest Common Sequence

The basic requirement for this project is to implement the Local Alignment algorithm into a standalone program. It should take two data inputs: one large target text sequence stored in a text file and one short query text sequence entered at the prompt. The program should also accept a number k from the prompt to indicate that local alignments of the k top highest scores will be traced and outputted from the program.

To execute:
1.) Compile the code by below command:
      javac -cp LocalAlignment.java
2.) Then run by below command:
      java LocalAlignment
